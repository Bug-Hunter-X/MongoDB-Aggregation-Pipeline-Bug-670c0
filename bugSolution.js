```javascript
//Corrected aggregation pipeline
db.collection.aggregate([
  {$match: { /* some filter */ }},
  {$group: {_id: "$field", count: {$sum: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}},
  {$limit: 10},
  {$project: {_id: "$_id", count: 1}}
])
//Added a $project stage to inspect the results before the limit stage, which aids in debugging the pipeline's behavior.
```

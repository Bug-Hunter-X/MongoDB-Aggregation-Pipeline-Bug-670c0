# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that can lead to unexpected results. The issue arises from an incorrectly structured pipeline, specifically in the grouping and sorting stages.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline intended to group documents by a specific field, count occurrences, sort by count, and limit the results. However, there's a potential issue where the grouping or sorting logic might not be implemented correctly.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the aggregation pipeline stages to ensure they correctly implement the intended logic.  Consider adding additional stages for debugging, such as a `$project` stage to inspect intermediate results.
